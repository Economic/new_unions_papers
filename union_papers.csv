We posit that RTW laws weaken collective bargaining power, increase free riding, and ultimately reduce employee welfare. We document a significant employee welfare decline following RTW adoption, especially among firms in highly unionized industries. The deterioration is driven by reductions in employee involvement, profit sharing, and work–life balance provisions. Results remain robust to alternative specifications, local unobservables, endogeneity concerns, and multiple identification checks. Overall, our findings highlight important implications for policymakers, labor unions, and employers considering the broader consequences of RTW legislation.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70020,new,2025-12-20,2025-12-20T00:00:00Z

Robots do not affect the total employment rate but significantly increase the involuntary atypical employment share, mainly through fixed‐term work. Software and databases increase total employment and are neutral for atypical employment. Higher trade union density mitigates the robots' impact on atypical employment, while employment protection legislation plays no role. Using historical decompositions, we attribute 1–2 percentage points of a 15% average atypical employment share in our sample to automation.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70017,new,2025-12-19,2025-12-19T00:00:00Z

McLachlan; Mark Stuart,2025-12-04,"ABSTRACT This paper demonstrates the dynamics of legitimacy in integrative bargaining over restructuring. Through a case study of SteelCo, we show that cognitive legitimacy is essential to the identification of integrative potential, which interacts with pragmatic and moral legitimacy as bargaining evolves. Our findings also reveal the two‐way interrelationship between legitimacy and bargaining: just as legitimacy impacts the bargaining process, the conduct and outcomes of bargaining impact legitimacy. Our analysis highlights the risk integrative bargaining presents for unions, as it can involve not a single act of compromise but a gradual weakening of resources predicated on their moral legitimacy among workers.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70019,updated,2025-12-07,2025-12-09T05:39:59Z

It highlights that while union identity is key to understanding strategic variation, legitimacy also plays a crucial role as unions must continuously earn and maintain it with various constituencies. Using cases from French automobile manufacturing and public healthcare, the article examines how local unions with distinct identities prioritize different forms and sources of legitimacy and, in turn, how this influences strategic choice. The findings show that unions formulate their strategies not only based on their identity, but also according to the need to uphold legitimacy with diverse constituencies.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70016,updated,2025-12-06,2025-12-07T05:39:25Z

New technologies such as algorithmic management (AM) represent novel sources of contestation, raising questions for workers and unions. Our study examines the social processes union leaders use to navigate the transformation of rules that organise work and power relations under AM in hotel housekeeping. Drawing on everyday social processes at the workplace and applying a relational lens, we identify three interrelated strategies: (1) collective sensemaking through skill‐building and coordination of shared interests; (2) consultation and negotiation, which involve relational dimensions with management; and (3) collective action, which leaders adapt to the context of technology. These strategies modify rules to realise workers’ interests and, in some cases, coalesce into new institutional rules. We show how union leaders build power from the bottom‐up and how power resources, and worker power in the context of technological change, can be situated in everyday social processes.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70025,updated,2025-12-02,2025-12-03T05:38:38Z

On the one hand, immigrants are expected to be more positive towards unions due to their lower economic capital and greater need for job protection. On the other hand, immigrants may hold more pessimistic attitudes towards unions because of their reduced social network, lower perceived benefits of collective action and unions’ historical aversion to immigrant workers. Here, we contribute to this understudied field of research by concentrating on increasing job precarity in non‐standard employment forms which is highly concentrated among immigrant workers. More specifically, we ask to what extent does the internationalization of the workforce and the increasing presence of non‐standard employment relate to attitudes towards trade unions in advanced democracies? We argue that immigrants in precarious employment face a double vulnerability where the distinct importance of the workplace for the social and political integration of immigrants, the reinforcement of pre‐existing immigrant‐specific labour market discrimination, and the link between employment and residence status could explain why job precarity has particularly negative effects on immigrants´view of unions compared to natives. Using an original survey data from 13 Western European countries, we show that while immigrant status alone is not a predictor of attitudes towards unions, immigrants in temporary contracts have significantly more adverse attitudes towards unions than those immigrants in permanent contracts. Importantly, when compared with native workers, there is a wider cleavage in attitudes towards unions among immigrant workers based on the precarity of their employment status, highlighting this clear intersection of immigrant status and employment precarity in shaping attitudes towards unions.

iza18265,The Evolution of Hours Worked and the Gender Wage Gap: Theory and Evidence from Four Countries,Daniele Checchi; Daniel Kreisman; Cecilia García-Peñalosa,2025-11-01,"We consider the contribution of the intensive margin of labor supply (hours worked above zero) to the gender wage gap across four economies (Germany, France, US, UK) over a long time-horizon. We first build a model in which firms offer two wage contracts – one that pays a fixed wage but allows workers to choose their preferred number of hours up to “full time”, and a second in which wages are relative to imperfectly observable productivity but hours can be limitless. The former includes part- and full-time work, while the latter represents a class of workers who often must supply very long hours but who can then earn potentially unlimited remuneration. We then apply a Oaxaca decomposition for part-, full-, and over-time workers to observe the relative contribution of sorting and remuneration across these hours “regimes” over time and across countries. Through this, we show that while female employment in over-time work increased and the gender wage decreased, this was not driven by increasing selection but rather by a decrease in the unexplained portion of the wage gap over time. We conclude by considering the contribution of unions and labor market flexibility to these cross-country differences.",IZA Discussion Paper,https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/18265/the-evolution-of-hours-worked-and-the-gender-wage-gap-theory-and-evidence-from-four-countries,old,2025-11-20,2025-11-20T00:00:00Z

Drawing on social norms theory and social identity theory, we hypothesize that religiosity is negatively associated with industrial action. Our findings support the latter explanation, where we find stronger effects when the likelihood of shared identity is higher. Analyses of negotiated outcomes following union shareholder activism mitigate concerns that employee preferences alone drive these results. Further evidence indicates that higher local religiosity reduces firms' use of strategic mechanisms designed to enhance management's leverage over unions, highlighting the broader role of cultural context in shaping management–labor interactions.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70012,new,2025-11-11,2025-11-11T00:00:00Z

Leybourne; Robert Taylor,2024-11-10,"ABSTRACT The Bonferroni test is widely used in empirical studies investigating predictability in asset returns by strongly persistent and endogenous predictors. Its formulation, however, only allows for a constant mean in the predictor, seemingly at odds with many of the predictors used in practice. We establish the asymptotic size and local power properties of the test, and the corresponding Bonferroni ‐test, under a local‐to‐zero specification for a linear trend in the predictor, revealing that size and power depend on the magnitude of the trend for both. To rectify this, we develop with‐trend variants of the operational Bonferroni and tests. However, where a trend is not present in the predictor, we show that these tests lose (both finite sample and asymptotic local) power relative to the extant constant‐only versions of the tests. In practice, uncertainty will necessarily exist over whether a linear trend is genuinely present in the predictor or not. To deal with this, we also develop hybrid tests based on union‐of‐rejections and switching mechanisms to capitalise on the relative power advantages of the constant‐only tests when a trend is absent (or very weak) and the with‐trend tests otherwise. A further extension allows the use of a conventional ‐test where the predictor appears to be weakly persistent. We show that, overall, our recommended hybrid test can offer excellent size and power properties regardless of whether or not a linear trend is present in the predictor, or the predictor's degrees of persistence and endogeneity. An empirical application illustrates the practical relevance of our new approach.

Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34057,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

We assess hypotheses on the role of structural (unionisation, employer organisation) and political (government partisanship, government strength) factors on the extent of cooperation between governments, trade unions and employers in public policymaking. We find a declining trend in the overall extent of social dialogue in the countries surveyed. Using panel regressions, we show that higher levels of social dialogue are more prevalent among governments where there is a balance of power between right‐wing and left‐wing parties, and thus where unions and employers can act as ‘brokers’ between left and right parties. We find no association between most structural factors (unionisation, collective bargaining coverage, employer organisation) and levels of social dialogue.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12863,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

After controlling for worker heterogeneity using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM) two-way fixed effects approach, we find that unionized firms pay about 15 log points more than non-unionized firms. Forty percent of this gap is linked to productivity differences between unionized and non-unionized firms as measured by value added per worker. The remaining gap reflects unions’ ability to extract more rents for workers. Our estimates imply that unions raise pay among unionized workers by around 9 log points.

Yet, urban governments face limitations that are not experienced by private sector entities. A city cannot just stop policing if it decides it is bad at policing. Typically, public compensation and personnel policies are highly regulated either by law or by union contracts. City governments do, however, have one great advantage over private entities: a greater ability to learn from their peers. City governments do similar things throughout the world, while companies frequently specialize. Private companies have strong incentives to hide the trade secrets that make them more productive, cities do not. As individual cities do not have an incentive to make it easier for other governments to learn from them, multinational entities like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank could enable that learning.

Across all studies, we find that inequality undermines union strength through multiple channels. First, workers with high individual bargaining power are more likely to withdraw support in unequal environments, preferring individual over collective bargaining. Second, union organizers strategically respond to inequality in ways that may preserve membership but limit redistribution, such as shifting their campaign away from wages and choosing smaller, more homogeneous bargaining units. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential for “inequality traps,” where rising inequality erodes the very institutions designed to counteract it.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33978,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Exposure to the law increased the incumbent governor’s vote share by about 20% of his margin of victory and reduced campaign contributions to his opponent.

Despite a declining trend in the OECD in coverage and especially union membership, a large share of formal workers around the world are still covered by collective bargaining agreements. We describe the substantial institutional variation across a variety of countries, highlighting research done with modern research designs and recently available administrative datasets. We then estimate a canonical empirical model of individual-level coverage effects and selection in harmonized cross-country data across 18 advanced economies (in Europe and North America). We estimate collective bargaining coverage premia, compression, selection, and spillover coefficients in each country, and use these to document considerable heterogeneity in collective bargaining coverage effects on the wage structure. While there is a strong negative relationship between collective bargaining coverage and wage inequality across countries, substantial uncertainties remain about the underlying mechanisms. Coverage effects may operate through direct premia, selection, or spillovers onto non-covered wages, but distinguishing and quantifying these channels and how they vary across institutional contexts remains a key challenge for future research. In our data, we find that the direct effect of coverage on wages of covered workers does not explain much of the cross-country correlation between coverage and inequality. While compelling research designs often result from specific institutional variation, we also emphasize that these contextual details must be accounted for when comparing estimates across industrial relations systems. A particularly pressing need is for more compelling causal evidence on spillover effects, which could help reconcile conflicting micro and macro evidence on how collective bargaining shapes the wage distribution.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33267,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil and job moves across multi-firm unions, we estimate over 4,800 union-specific pay premia. Unions explain 3–4% of earnings variation. While unions raise wages on average, the standard deviation in union effects is large (6–7%). Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law. Linking premia to detailed data on union attributes, we find that unions with strike activity, collective bargaining agreements, internal competition, and skilled leaders secure higher wages. High-premium unions compress wage gaps by education while the average union exacerbates them. Post right-to-work, however, worker support for high-premium unions falls when between-group bargaining differentials are large. Our findings show that unions are not a monolith—their structure and actions shape their wage effects and, consequently, worker support.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34139,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

By merging collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) to linked employer-employee data in Brazil, I combine rich contracted amenities with wage information. I implement a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits a court ruling enforcing CBA continuation (i.e., ultractivity) to estimate the effects of union bargaining power. Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment—increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution. A revealed preference approach shows that amenities account for 45% of total compensation gains. These findings suggest that collective bargaining can offset monopsony power, but employers retain the right-to-manage workforce composition.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34186,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Bordo; Oliver Bush; Ryland Thomas,2025-07-24,"Discussion of the causes of the Great Inflation in the UK during the 1970s has centred around the relative importance of two potential explanations, which we label “bad luck” – the occurrence of unusually large commodity price and supply-side shocks - and “bad policy” reflecting failures in both monetary and prices and incomes policies. By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to most of British history, it was not used to stabilise the public finances. Instead, it was used to keep unemployment down and growth up, to subsidise losers from terms of trade shocks and to secure deals with the unions.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34063,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

This paper uncovers systematic gendered effects on family structure and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, we show that having a firstborn daughter, rather than a son, significantly influences women’s family dynamics. Women with a female firstborn experience higher long-term marriage rates but are less likely to marry the child’s father when the birth occurs prior to formal union. They also face higher divorce rates and greater likelihood of entering polygamous unions. Despite these marital transitions, they tend to have more children. Our analysis further reveals that having a firstborn daughter is associated with poorer living standards and adverse health outcomes for mothers. To examine the mechanisms driving these patterns, we employ a geographic regression discontinuity design along ancestral ethnic borders separating matrilineal and patrilineal traditions. This approach highlights patrilineality as a key driver, shaping both marriage dynamics and fertility.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33505,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

This paper develops novel natural language methods to analyze the empirical determinants and economic value of these rights using a new collection of 30,000 CBAs from Canada in the period 1986-2015. We parse legally binding rights (e.g., “workers shall receive...”) and obligations (e.g., “the employer shall pro-vide...”) from contract text, and validate our measures through evaluation of clause pairs and comparison to firm surveys on HR practices. Using time-varying province-level variation in labor income tax rates, we find that higher taxes increase the share of worker-rights clauses while reducing pre-tax wages in unionized firms, consistent with a substitution effect away from taxed wages toward untaxed rights. Further, an exogenous increase in the value of outside options (from a leave-one-out instrument for labor demand) increases the share of worker rights clauses in CBAs. Combining the regression estimates, we infer that a one-standard-deviation increase in worker rights is valued at about 5.7% of wages.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33605,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Arguably, life satisfaction serves as a more comprehensive measure of the benefits of union membership and warrants closer examination. Using all relevant waves from the German Socio‐Economic Panel between 1985 and 2019, we find a negative correlation between trade union membership and life satisfaction in OLS and FE specifications. The association may arise because union members are more concerned about their job and the economic situation and less satisfied with their work. Social capital and wages also perform as channels between membership and life satisfaction. The negative correlation is more pronounced in settings in which trade unions are relatively weak.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12861,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Various subgraphs—e.g. links, triangles, cliques, stars—are generated and their union results in a network. We show that SUGMs are identified and establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of parameter estimators in empirically relevant cases. We show that a simple four-parameter SUGM matches basic patterns in empirical networks more closely than four standard models (with many more dimensions): (1) stochastic block models; (2) models with node-level unobserved heterogeneity; (3) latent space models; and (4) exponential random graphs. We illustrate the framework’s value via several applications using networks from rural India. We study whether network structure helps enforce risk-sharing and whether cross-caste interactions are more likely to be private.

Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed-preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially composed a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and benefited both workers and employers.

The regression‐adjusted difference between union members’ and non‐members’ hourly earnings has been falling since the Great Recession. The union differential in weekly wages has been more stable. Although it fell by around 5 log points during COVID, it remains 15 log points. This weekly earnings differential arises from both a higher hourly wage of around 10 log points and longer working hours (5 log points). The working hours differential partly reflects unions’ ability to tackle under‐employment, such that union workers work closer to the hours they desire than their non‐union counterparts. The traditional focus on hourly wage differentials underplays the important role trade unions play in maintaining members’ weekly earnings by ensuring workers receive the paid hours they desire.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12871,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.",The Review of Economic Studies,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf076,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

The authors develop an agentic theory of union resourcefulness based on these findings, which complements extant structural arguments.

By comparing five trade unions' social partnership responses in the US‐American and English healthcare systems, this article argues that trade unions' ideological position on partnerships and their level of ‘sectoral power’—which involves membership size and their recognized ability and willingness to pursue sector‐wide aims—influence social partnership choices in LMEs more so than national institutional factors. The article contributes to the study of social partnership by departing from the prevailing assumption that macro‐institutional supports are a necessary condition for unions’ strategic choice of social partnerships, instead, conceptualizing the organizational and sectoral conditions of a more agential pathway to social partnerships based partly on a novel type of union power (‘sectoral power’) where macro‐institutional supports are absent.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12395,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Findings show that inflation expectations, unemployment rates, wage growth, and COLA clauses are associated with fairly large effects on wage settlements that are much more prominent during the period prior to the Bank of Canada adopting an inflation target (i.e., before 1991). They also indicate that variables capturing inflation uncertainty and contracting costs do not have a large effect on contract duration, but contracting costs do have a larger effect on the use of indexing provisions.

The analysis replicates the standard findings on wage and hiring elasticity, potentially revealing an additional layer‐abstention from collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) could lead to a double markdown on wage costs. Moreover, employer concentration reduces both employer association membership and union representation within small firms. In concentrated labour markets, there is a higher likelihood of forgoing both first‐tier and second‐tier collective agreements, resulting in adverse effects on workers' wages and non‐wage attributes. Additionally, even when firms use CBAs, strategies to optimise labour costs at the expense of workers emerge, prominently featuring the misalignment of CBAs. Local labour market concentration increases employment practices that optimise and reduce labour costs, such as a greater reliance on part‐time contracts and external consultants. The analysis shows that reduced competition in the labour market influences diverse facets of employment relationships, revealing patterns that extend beyond the conventional understanding of wage and hiring dynamics.",Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.70002,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z
