The reported findings suggest strong positive effects across multiple subjects. In this report, we demonstrate that the school-level randomization cannot have been conducted as the author claims. Specifically, we show that the nine included Bangladeshi unions all have a share of either 0% or 100% treated or control schools. Additionally, we uncover irregularities in baseline scores, which for the same students and subjects vary systematically across the author’s data files in ways that are unique to either the treatment or control group. We also discovered data on two unreported outcomes and data collected from the year before the study began. Results using these data cast further doubt on the validity of the original study. Moreover, in a survey asking parents to evaluate the parent–teacher meetings, we find that parents in the control schools were more positive about this intervention than those in the treated schools. We also find undisclosed connections to two additional RCTs.",European Economic Review,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105021,new,2026-02-23,2026-02-23T00:00:00Z

Carpenter; Erwan Dujeancourt; Samuel Mann; Lucia Naldi,2025-05-09,"We use Swedish administrative data from 2001-2021 to study sexual orientation and multiple job holding. We identify over 19,000 employed individuals who ever entered a legal same-sex union and compare their outcomes with all employed individuals who were only ever in different-sex unions. We find that sexual minority individuals are significantly more likely than otherwise similar heterosexual individuals to hold multiple jobs. We explore four mechanisms: financial constraints, self-insurance, career mobility, and job heterogeneity. We find evidence in line with self-insurance mechanisms for sexual minority men. For women, we find that career mobility is a likely explanation.",The Journal of Human Resources,https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.0324-13477r1,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W7128433132,Get on the Job and Organize: Standing Up for a Better Workplace and a Better World,Leonard Bierman; Rafael Gely,2026-02-09,"In Get on the Job and Organize, Jaz Brisack provides a well-written account of a trio of union organizing campaigns in the United States in the last decade. Brisack briefly describes unsuccessful campaigns involving Nissan and Tesla. She spends most of the book, however, describing the successful campaign involving Starbucks, which started in upstate New York and eventually expanded to over 600 stores across the United States. Brisack's account is personal, as she was involved in all three efforts, and provides insights which likely would have been missed by outside observers. For instance, Brisack describes Starbucks’ reaction to the organizing campaign of sending supervisors and high-level executives to the specific stores targeted by the union. She describes not only their actions but also their comments and even their outfits (pp. 104–105), presenting a vivid portrait of the company's strategy. Her account is not only personal, but also well-grounded in history, labour relations theory and legal context. For example, Brisack describes how Starbucks stretched the limits of the law to implement their campaign ‘playbook’ by ‘targeting individuals, targeting stores for closure, and targeting all workers in a sweeping form of collective punishment’ (p. 192), and later during collective negotiations by impeding bargaining. Brisack points out that US labour law, ‘orders companies to bargain in good faith, but lacks authority to punish those that don't’ (p. 204). Along the way, Brisack touches on various other important issues for those interested in labour relations, such as the tension that existed between the local organizers and the international union (pp. 214–219, 238–260), and her assessment of the most important benefits of unionization. She notes, ‘organizing allows workers the ability to take ownership and agency over the systems that try to strip people of their dignity, personhood, and self-determination’ (p. 267). The book provides a broad and helpful portrait of the organizing process in the United States and of the difficulties workers confront in that regard. At its core, however, this book is about something called ‘salting’, as evidenced by the book's dedication ‘[t]o the courageous, dedicated and caring salts …, who volunteered to get jobs at Starbucks and helped revitalize the labour movement’. Quoting a top union leader, Brisack defines salting as ‘the practice of getting a job at a nonunion workplace with the intention of organizing it’ (p. 39). Brisack describes her role as cofounder of the Inside Organizer School (IOS), a school founded with the goal of training people to become ‘salts’ by providing training programs on how to successfully ‘hire into’ an organization with the intent of union organizing. At the IOS, prospective salts practiced how to respond to job interview questions. For example, in response to a question like ‘[w]hat do you think of employees that gripe, gripe, gripe?’, a salt is advised to answer, ‘[I]f they don't like their jobs, they should leave rather than dragging everyone else down with them’ (p. 45). Brisack then describes in detail the Starbucks organizing campaign which involved her becoming a salt at Starbucks. Despite her constant fear that Starbucks would find out that she was a union organizer and not hire her, after 2 months of follow-up calls and visits she landed a salting job at the Elmwood Buffalo, New York Starbucks store (p. 63). Brisack set about consciously ‘befriending’ her coworkers, finding out relevant useful information about them and turning them into ‘peppers’ (extant workers who become part of the organizing process). Brisack's efforts ended in success when the majority of workers at Elmwood voted in favour of unionization and became the first unionized Starbucks coffee shop in the United States. Brisack's commitment and admiration for salting as an organizing strategy is clear. The practice is described as ‘heroic and righteous’ and ‘unparalleled in its effectiveness’ (pp. 39–40). As such, the book could be seen as something of a paean to salting and its use as a union organizing method from the unique perspective of a salt herself. Despite Brisack's enthusiasm for salting and its demonstrable effectiveness in the Starbucks campaign, Brisack's account reveals various issues that merit mentioning. First, salting involves a non-trivial amount of deception. Brisack notes that becoming a salt involves the ‘contortion’ of becoming a ‘commodity’ to your employer while also maintaining qualities that allow you to ‘build relationships of trust and camaraderie with coworkers’ of the kind that gets them to support labour unionization (p. 44). That is, obfuscating the truth is necessary and almost inevitable. Second, this deception is costly, taxing and has consequences. Brisack describes the tension she experienced in having to ‘ingratiate …. to management’, while not being seen as ‘too much of a goody-goody’ to her coworkers (p. 79). Brisack also describes the discomfort she felt when asked by coworkers at their first organizing meeting if she had come to Starbucks to organize them. ‘I wanted to tell them the whole truth’, writes Brisack, ‘but it was still risky’ (p. 101). Brisack also notes that while the organizing effort at Starbucks was successful, as of the book's mid-2025 publication the goal of reaching a labour contract with the company had not yet been achieved. If Brisack and her fellow union organizers at Starbucks are ultimately not able to reach labour contracts with the company, their organizational victories may in many respects end up being somewhat Pyrrhic in nature. Finally, Brisack laments how difficult the organizing process has become. The reason is rather complex and relates to the predominance the US Supreme Court gives employer's property interests. This policy choice has limited the ability of non-employee union organizers to communicate with employees at work, leaving unions few options but to engage in salting as the tactic of choice.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70045,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z

https://openalex.org/W4408360634,Rigid yet resilient: Firms’ margins of adjustment to demand shocks in regulated labour markets,Claudio Lucifora; Federica Origo,2025-03-12,"• We study firm labour cost adjustment to changes in real sales • Adjustment works through employment and short-time work • Wages are less sensitive to declining sales • Unionized firms use more short-time work, reducing employment adjustment • Profits significantly react to declining sales in low unionized firms We investigate how firms adjust to demand shocks when wages and employment determination are regulated. Using firm-level data for the Italian metal engineering industry from 2009 to 2021, we estimate the elasticity of the wage bill to changes in firm's real sales. We disentangle the effect on wage components (base wage and wage cushion) and labour inputs (permanent or temporary employment and working hours). Results show that the elasticity of the wage bill to demand shocks mainly works through adjustment of working hours (especially via short-time work) and partly employment, while wages are less sensitive. Unions at the workplace reduce employment adjustment through a more intensive use of short-time work schemes. The lower employment adjustment to changes in sales in unionized firms does not depend on past investments or innovation, and it is associated to higher responsiveness of profits to declining sales only in weakly unionized firms.",Labour Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2025.102706,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4408382786,Changemakers. Radical Strategies for Social Movement Organiser,Martin Parker,2025-03-11,"When faced with the scale and complexity of the problems that face us, it is tempting to pull up the duvet and weep silently. The polycrisis reaches everywhere, and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Radical academics might like to think that the power of evidence and a reasoned argument might win the day, but their muttering is rarely heard outside the seminar room, or from behind the publishers paywall. So how to keep hope alive? In this book, such handwringing is put aside in favour of practical advice on how radicals might win. Jane Holgate and John Page have form in this area, having been long involved in many social protests, both workplace based and concerned with other social and environmental issues. They are serial dissenters, and in this intriguing and well-written book, they use their experience to put forward strategies that they think social movement organizers need to think about if they want to win. Some of these ideas come from trade unions and workplace struggles, but they range much more widely than that, referring to the civil rights movement in the United States, hunt saboteurs, gay rights, anti-fascist groups and so on. Holgate and Page are interested in what radicals can learn about ‘organizing for transformational social change’ (8) from successful and unsuccessful campaigns. This means being clear about strategy and theories of change because the point of the exercise is to gain power, not just smash windows and then go home. This means producing durable bottom up social movements. According to a pop management fable which they quote approvingly, if you chop a spider's head off, it will die, but a starfish can grow a new body from a severed limb (Brafman and Beckstrom 2008). The implication is that starfish organizations are more robust, and that organizers should be sceptical about charismatic leadership because it is vulnerable and myopic. It would be nice if someone had explained that to the US tech bros. For their illustrations, the authors turn to a more honourable tradition of organizing in the United States. Saul Alinsky was the founder of the Industrial Areas Foundation, a community organizing network established in 1940 in Chicago. Myles Horton established the Highlander Folk School (now the Highlander Research and Education Center) in Tennessee in 1932. Alinsky, in his 1971 Rules for Radicals, described a form of charismatic leadership which was always trying to stay ahead by setting the stage for any confrontation with the opposition. Horton, by contrast, was convinced that robust organization must be based on democratic community decision-making. The difference between their top down and bottom up approaches really structures this book, with the authors acknowledging the importance of Alinsky's inspiring ability to throw the opposition off balance, but continually preferring Horton's careful insistence that radicalism cannot be handed down from on high, but must be built by the people themselves. What Holgate and Page really want to encourage is not merely mobilizing, getting your supporters onto the streets for a demonstration, but long-term self-propelled organizing. Much of this work will not be heroic, not a ‘moment of the whirlwind’ (88) in which slogans are coined while speakers declaim, but a patient building of networks and resources which produce an inexorable movement towards change. Such organizing is also necessarily democratic and inclusive because it must connect to as many people as possible in order to be successful. Vanguardism will not work in the long term. Being ‘stuck in protest’ (240) will not help build robust and sticky alternatives. Another recent book from the same publisher comes to similar conclusions in terms of the long run prospects for enduring social change (Roth and Saunders 2024). It seems that change happens because of hard and hidden work in multiple sites, not dramatic confrontations. I really liked this book, but kept on hoping that it would not fall into the hands of the enemy. The strategies that Holgate and Page describe are, of course, reversible and could just as easily be applied by ‘take back control’ Brexiteers, MAGA populists, neoliberal managers and a host of pantomime villains. That is the problem with politics because there are always at least two sides, and they do not agree on who the white hats and the black hats are. It is also interesting that so many of the terms that the authors use are the staple of the business school too—leadership and management (and the difference between the two), as well as strategy, organization, empowerment, change, narrative and so on. It is sad, and I do not blame the authors for this, that there has been so little connection between industrial relations and critical management studies on these questions because many of these terms have been the objects of common critique and their reinvention is so important if we are to produce a low-carbon, high inclusion, high democracy economy (Parker 2018). This requires knowledge that goes beyond academic books, and Holgate and Page are also teaching these lessons through the Ella Baker School of Organizing, a training ground for activists of all kinds. Ella Baker played an important part in the civil rights struggles in the United States for most of the 20th century. In 1960, she helped to found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and throughout her life was a powerful advocate for grassroots organization, for the ability of oppressed peoples of whatever kind to express their own criticisms of the system that bears down on them, and to formulate strategies for change. This book is a powerful argument for the possibility that we all might learn from Ella Baker and connect the university to wider struggles for social justice.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12878,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z

De La Haye; Andrew Keyes; Pauline de Becdelièvre; Lorenzo Frangi; Jack Fiorito,2026-02-17,"ABSTRACT Satisfaction with union representation is often linked to a union's ability to improve compensation and working conditions (workplace instrumentality). Yet, union activities extend beyond the workplace, affecting social, political and economic outcomes. We explore workplace instrumentality and prosocial unionism as predictors of members’ ‘union experience’, a proxy for union satisfaction, in the United States, Canada and France. We propose that the workplace instrumentality effect on union satisfaction is strongest where union strategies are more market‐oriented (e.g., Canada and the United States), and that the prosocial unionism effect on union satisfaction is strongest where unions are more oriented to society and class (e.g., France).

We propose a model that is more resistant to this critique in an effort to obtain credible estimates of key policy multipliers. Its success derives from the union of two separate but mutually reinforcing transmission mechanisms: unemployment with partial insurance and increasing returns from producer entry. Results show that our dual approach can generate positive consumption multipliers for a calibration choice that is in keeping with external data on the individual consumption cost of unemployment and on the average size of firm markups.,Economic Inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.70050,new,2026-02-19,2026-02-19T00:00:00Z

We address this question by building a two-region innovation-driven growth model with endogenous technology diffusion via FDI. We use the model to analyse R&amp;D subsidy cooperation in the EU, which has a common trade and monetary policy but where a coordinated innovation policy is still in its infancy. Stark differences in innovation capabilities between the West (old member states) and the East (new member states) shape optimal policies. Western countries have higher R&amp;D efficiency and serve as primary sources of knowledge spillovers, through FDI-driven technology transfer. Cooperation is driven by two factors: correcting distortions from subsidy competition, the strategic motive, and leveraging intertemporal knowledge spillovers that sustain growth. A coordinated policy involves substantial subsidies for the West and taxes for the East, reflecting the West’s superior R&amp;D efficiency and role as a key source of knowledge spillovers. Both regions experience welfare gains, primarily by internalising cross-border spillovers. We find strong complementarity between innovation and FDI subsidies, showing that jointly supporting knowledge creation and diffusion yields greater benefits than implementing each policy in isolation.",Journal of the European Economic Association,https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvag002,new,2026-02-13,2026-02-13T00:00:00Z

We find low entry rates, high exit rates and high levels of productivity dispersion in the sector. The entry of new locals is not associated with productivity improvements among incumbents but has a small negative association with locals' survival rates. These findings indicate that inter‐union competition is not effective in raising productivity and the effects of creative destruction are weak, with these processes likely insufficient to stem the sector's overall decline.",Economic Inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.70038,new,2026-01-22,2026-01-22T00:00:00Z

New technologies such as algorithmic management (AM) represent novel sources of contestation, raising questions for workers and unions. Our study examines the social processes union leaders use to navigate the transformation of rules that organise work and power relations under AM in hotel housekeeping. Drawing on everyday social processes at the workplace and applying a relational lens, we identify three interrelated strategies: (1) collective sensemaking through skill‐building and coordination of shared interests; (2) consultation and negotiation, which involve relational dimensions with management; and (3) collective action, which leaders adapt to the context of technology. These strategies modify rules to realise workers’ interests and, in some cases, coalesce into new institutional rules.

https://openalex.org/W4416344729,Job Precarity and Attitudes Towards Labour Unions: The Mitigating Role of Immigrant Background,Anna‐Lena Nadler; Elif Naz Kayran,2025-11-17,"ABSTRACT Despite their significant and growing role in the European workforce, to date, little research attention has been paid to immigrant workers’ attitudes towards trade unions and provided mixed results. On the one hand, immigrants are expected to be more positive towards unions due to their lower economic capital and greater need for job protection. On the other hand, immigrants may hold more pessimistic attitudes towards unions because of their reduced social network, lower perceived benefits of collective action and unions’ historical aversion to immigrant workers. Here, we contribute to this understudied field of research by concentrating on increasing job precarity in non‐standard employment forms which is highly concentrated among immigrant workers. More specifically, we ask to what extent does the internationalization of the workforce and the increasing presence of non‐standard employment relate to attitudes towards trade unions in advanced democracies? We argue that immigrants in precarious employment face a double vulnerability where the distinct importance of the workplace for the social and political integration of immigrants, the reinforcement of pre‐existing immigrant‐specific labour market discrimination, and the link between employment and residence status could explain why job precarity has particularly negative effects on immigrants´view of unions compared to natives. Using an original survey data from 13 Western European countries, we show that while immigrant status alone is not a predictor of attitudes towards unions, immigrants in temporary contracts have significantly more adverse attitudes towards unions than those immigrants in permanent contracts.

We first build a model in which firms offer two wage contracts – one that pays a fixed wage but allows workers to choose their preferred number of hours up to “full time”, and a second in which wages are relative to imperfectly observable productivity but hours can be limitless. The former includes part- and full-time work, while the latter represents a class of workers who often must supply very long hours but who can then earn potentially unlimited remuneration. We then apply a Oaxaca decomposition for part-, full-, and over-time workers to observe the relative contribution of sorting and remuneration across these hours “regimes” over time and across countries. Through this, we show that while female employment in over-time work increased and the gender wage decreased, this was not driven by increasing selection but rather by a decrease in the unexplained portion of the wage gap over time. We conclude by considering the contribution of unions and labor market flexibility to these cross-country differences.",IZA Discussion Paper,https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/18265/the-evolution-of-hours-worked-and-the-gender-wage-gap-theory-and-evidence-from-four-countries,old,2025-11-20,2025-11-20T00:00:00Z

On the one hand, immigrants are expected to be more positive towards unions due to their lower economic capital and greater need for job protection. On the other hand, immigrants may hold more pessimistic attitudes towards unions because of their reduced social network, lower perceived benefits of collective action and unions’ historical aversion to immigrant workers. Here, we contribute to this understudied field of research by concentrating on increasing job precarity in non‐standard employment forms which is highly concentrated among immigrant workers. More specifically, we ask to what extent does the internationalization of the workforce and the increasing presence of non‐standard employment relate to attitudes towards trade unions in advanced democracies? We argue that immigrants in precarious employment face a double vulnerability where the distinct importance of the workplace for the social and political integration of immigrants, the reinforcement of pre‐existing immigrant‐specific labour market discrimination, and the link between employment and residence status could explain why job precarity has particularly negative effects on immigrants´view of unions compared to natives. Using an original survey data from 13 Western European countries, we show that while immigrant status alone is not a predictor of attitudes towards unions, immigrants in temporary contracts have significantly more adverse attitudes towards unions than those immigrants in permanent contracts. Importantly, when compared with native workers, there is a wider cleavage in attitudes towards unions among immigrant workers based on the precarity of their employment status, highlighting this clear intersection of immigrant status and employment precarity in shaping attitudes towards unions.

Drawing on social norms theory and social identity theory, we hypothesize that religiosity is negatively associated with industrial action. Our findings support the latter explanation, where we find stronger effects when the likelihood of shared identity is higher.

Leybourne; Robert Taylor,2024-11-10,"ABSTRACT The Bonferroni test is widely used in empirical studies investigating predictability in asset returns by strongly persistent and endogenous predictors. Its formulation, however, only allows for a constant mean in the predictor, seemingly at odds with many of the predictors used in practice. We establish the asymptotic size and local power properties of the test, and the corresponding Bonferroni ‐test, under a local‐to‐zero specification for a linear trend in the predictor, revealing that size and power depend on the magnitude of the trend for both. To rectify this, we develop with‐trend variants of the operational Bonferroni and tests. However, where a trend is not present in the predictor, we show that these tests lose (both finite sample and asymptotic local) power relative to the extant constant‐only versions of the tests. In practice, uncertainty will necessarily exist over whether a linear trend is genuinely present in the predictor or not. To deal with this, we also develop hybrid tests based on union‐of‐rejections and switching mechanisms to capitalise on the relative power advantages of the constant‐only tests when a trend is absent (or very weak) and the with‐trend tests otherwise. A further extension allows the use of a conventional ‐test where the predictor appears to be weakly persistent. We show that, overall, our recommended hybrid test can offer excellent size and power properties regardless of whether or not a linear trend is present in the predictor, or the predictor's degrees of persistence and endogeneity. An empirical application illustrates the practical relevance of our new approach.

Unlike top managers, frontline leaders are essential for implementing organizational strategies by maintaining team cohesion when shirking is profitable for workers. We study this in the context of the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, using data on 2.2 million soldiers and tracking captains and their 100-soldier companies at weekly frequency throughout the conflict. We estimate leader fixed effects during non-combat weeks to measure leadership quality in a leader value-added framework. We validate this measure by showing that captains were not assigned based on prior unit performance or observable pre-war characteristics. High-quality leaders earned more after the war, but not before, and were more frequently recognized as good leaders in their postwar biographies. Daily event-study estimates around major battles show that better captains significantly reduced desertions in combat. Exploiting quasi-random leader turnover, we find evidence that this effect is causal. Using digitized battle maps, we rule out risk aversion as a mechanism and find instead that better leaders had higher mortality rates, consistent with a leading-by-example explanation. We also document modest learning-by-doing effects. These findings highlight the often-overlooked importance of frontline leadership, where direct supervision and interpersonal influence are strongest.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34057,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

We find a declining trend in the overall extent of social dialogue in the countries surveyed. Using panel regressions, we show that higher levels of social dialogue are more prevalent among governments where there is a balance of power between right‐wing and left‐wing parties, and thus where unions and employers can act as ‘brokers’ between left and right parties. We find no association between most structural factors (unionisation, collective bargaining coverage, employer organisation) and levels of social dialogue.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12863,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

After controlling for worker heterogeneity using the Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (AKM) two-way fixed effects approach, we find that unionized firms pay about 15 log points more than non-unionized firms. Forty percent of this gap is linked to productivity differences between unionized and non-unionized firms as measured by value added per worker. The remaining gap reflects unions’ ability to extract more rents for workers. Our estimates imply that unions raise pay among unionized workers by around 9 log points. The union effect grows to about 11 log points in an extension of the AKM approach where unions also affect the returns to unobservable worker characteristics.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33740,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Yet, urban governments face limitations that are not experienced by private sector entities. A city cannot just stop policing if it decides it is bad at policing. Typically, public compensation and personnel policies are highly regulated either by law or by union contracts. City governments do, however, have one great advantage over private entities: a greater ability to learn from their peers. City governments do similar things throughout the world, while companies frequently specialize. Private companies have strong incentives to hide the trade secrets that make them more productive, cities do not. As individual cities do not have an incentive to make it easier for other governments to learn from them, multinational entities like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank could enable that learning.

Across all studies, we find that inequality undermines union strength through multiple channels. First, workers with high individual bargaining power are more likely to withdraw support in unequal environments, preferring individual over collective bargaining. Second, union organizers strategically respond to inequality in ways that may preserve membership but limit redistribution, such as shifting their campaign away from wages and choosing smaller, more homogeneous bargaining units. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential for “inequality traps,” where rising inequality erodes the very institutions designed to counteract it.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33978,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Exposure to the law increased the incumbent governor’s vote share by about 20% of his margin of victory and reduced campaign contributions to his opponent.

Despite a declining trend in the OECD in coverage and especially union membership, a large share of formal workers around the world are still covered by collective bargaining agreements. We describe the substantial institutional variation across a variety of countries, highlighting research done with modern research designs and recently available administrative datasets. We then estimate a canonical empirical model of individual-level coverage effects and selection in harmonized cross-country data across 18 advanced economies (in Europe and North America). We estimate collective bargaining coverage premia, compression, selection, and spillover coefficients in each country, and use these to document considerable heterogeneity in collective bargaining coverage effects on the wage structure. While there is a strong negative relationship between collective bargaining coverage and wage inequality across countries, substantial uncertainties remain about the underlying mechanisms. Coverage effects may operate through direct premia, selection, or spillovers onto non-covered wages, but distinguishing and quantifying these channels and how they vary across institutional contexts remains a key challenge for future research. In our data, we find that the direct effect of coverage on wages of covered workers does not explain much of the cross-country correlation between coverage and inequality. While compelling research designs often result from specific institutional variation, we also emphasize that these contextual details must be accounted for when comparing estimates across industrial relations systems. A particularly pressing need is for more compelling causal evidence on spillover effects, which could help reconcile conflicting micro and macro evidence on how collective bargaining shapes the wage distribution.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33267,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Using linked employer-employee data from Brazil and job moves across multi-firm unions, we estimate over 4,800 union-specific pay premia. Unions explain 3–4% of earnings variation. While unions raise wages on average, the standard deviation in union effects is large (6–7%). Validating our approach, wages fall in markets with higher vs. lower union premia following a nationwide right-to-work law. Linking premia to detailed data on union attributes, we find that unions with strike activity, collective bargaining agreements, internal competition, and skilled leaders secure higher wages. High-premium unions compress wage gaps by education while the average union exacerbates them. Post right-to-work, however, worker support for high-premium unions falls when between-group bargaining differentials are large.

Strengthening unions raises wages and amenities without reducing employment—increasing retention despite some labor-labor substitution.

By reconsidering the historical and empirical record of inflation from 1950s to the early 1990s we show that the persistence of the Great Inflation in the UK cannot fully be explained by these factors, although these can account for some of the major fluctuations. Instead, underlying inflation and inflation expectations appear to be the result of a sequence of regime shifts. We argue those regime shifts are as much related to fundamental changes in fiscal policy as they are to monetary policy and union reforms. Our empirical evidence suggests that fiscal policy was at the heart of many of the problems in the UK during the Great Inflation. In contrast to most of British history, it was not used to stabilise the public finances. Instead, it was used to keep unemployment down and growth up, to subsidise losers from terms of trade shocks and to secure deals with the unions.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w34063,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

This paper uncovers systematic gendered effects on family structure and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, we show that having a firstborn daughter, rather than a son, significantly influences women’s family dynamics. Women with a female firstborn experience higher long-term marriage rates but are less likely to marry the child’s father when the birth occurs prior to formal union. They also face higher divorce rates and greater likelihood of entering polygamous unions. Despite these marital transitions, they tend to have more children. Our analysis further reveals that having a firstborn daughter is associated with poorer living standards and adverse health outcomes for mothers. To examine the mechanisms driving these patterns, we employ a geographic regression discontinuity design along ancestral ethnic borders separating matrilineal and patrilineal traditions.

We parse legally binding rights (e.g., “workers shall receive...”) and obligations (e.g., “the employer shall pro-vide...”) from contract text, and validate our measures through evaluation of clause pairs and comparison to firm surveys on HR practices. Using time-varying province-level variation in labor income tax rates, we find that higher taxes increase the share of worker-rights clauses while reducing pre-tax wages in unionized firms, consistent with a substitution effect away from taxed wages toward untaxed rights. Further, an exogenous increase in the value of outside options (from a leave-one-out instrument for labor demand) increases the share of worker rights clauses in CBAs. Combining the regression estimates, we infer that a one-standard-deviation increase in worker rights is valued at about 5.7% of wages.",NBER Working Paper,https://nber.org/papers/w33605,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Arguably, life satisfaction serves as a more comprehensive measure of the benefits of union membership and warrants closer examination. Using all relevant waves from the German Socio‐Economic Panel between 1985 and 2019, we find a negative correlation between trade union membership and life satisfaction in OLS and FE specifications.

His greatest victory occurred by the end of the 1970s when he argued that the Federal Reserve System, not corporations and unions with market power, was responsible for inflation. However, monetarism retreated in the early 1980s when high rates of growth of money failed to predict inflation. This paper re‐exposits the quantity theory of money and monetarism in an attempt to again make relevant Friedman's arguments for a rules‐based monetary policy and for an understanding of how in actual practice central banks control inflation assuming inflation is a monetary phenomenon.",Southern Economic Journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/soej.12751,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Blanchflower; Alex Bryson,2025-01-14,"ABSTRACT We examine union‐non‐union differentials in wages and hours in the United States over the last 50 years using data from the Current Population Survey. The regression‐adjusted difference between union members’ and non‐members’ hourly earnings has been falling since the Great Recession. The union differential in weekly wages has been more stable. Although it fell by around 5 log points during COVID, it remains 15 log points. This weekly earnings differential arises from both a higher hourly wage of around 10 log points and longer working hours (5 log points). The working hours differential partly reflects unions’ ability to tackle under‐employment, such that union workers work closer to the hours they desire than their non‐union counterparts. The traditional focus on hourly wage differentials underplays the important role trade unions play in maintaining members’ weekly earnings by ensuring workers receive the paid hours they desire.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12871,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Drawing on a longitudinal data set comprising 6,500 Better Work factory assessments across seven countries from 2015 to 2021, the authors compare violations of various FOA/CB elements to provide a general picture of the progress and problems of FOA/CB in supplier workplaces. They argue that suppliers are likely to selectively comply with FOA/CB elements that afford them some legitimacy but will violate the elements that impose significant costs on them. Specifically, the authors find fewer violations of union formation rights, in contrast to higher violations of union operation rights and of collective bargaining rights. Yet, when these latter rights are respected, they are associated with better compliance with other employment standards, with effective collective bargaining having the strongest effect.",Industrial and Labor Relations Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/00197939251314867,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action setup, leaders increase mobilization through coordination.

He also undertakes complementary analyses of contract duration and the use of Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) clauses to examine how variables capturing uncertainty and contracting costs affect contract length and the use of indexing provisions. Findings show that inflation expectations, unemployment rates, wage growth, and COLA clauses are associated with fairly large effects on wage settlements that are much more prominent during the period prior to the Bank of Canada adopting an inflation target (i.e., before 1991). They also indicate that variables capturing inflation uncertainty and contracting costs do not have a large effect on contract duration, but contracting costs do have a larger effect on the use of indexing provisions. Results suggest that indexing provisions are an important inflation coping mechanism for both wage settlements and contract duration, with bargaining pairs willing to trade off smaller base wage changes and longer contracts for them.",Industrial and Labor Relations Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/00197939251323234,old,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Various subgraphs—e.g. links, triangles, cliques, stars—are generated and their union results in a network. We show that SUGMs are identified and establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of parameter estimators in empirically relevant cases. We show that a simple four-parameter SUGM matches basic patterns in empirical networks more closely than four standard models (with many more dimensions): (1) stochastic block models; (2) models with node-level unobserved heterogeneity; (3) latent space models; and (4) exponential random graphs. We illustrate the framework’s value via several applications using networks from rural India. We study whether network structure helps enforce risk-sharing and whether cross-caste interactions are more likely to be private.

Starting in 2015, Brazil’s largest trade union federation made women central to its agenda. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed-preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially composed a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and benefited both workers and employers. They illustrate the potential for unions to improve workplace quality by focusing on the needs of less represented workers.",The Quarterly Journal of Economics,https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf024,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.",The Review of Economic Studies,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf076,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

The authors address the puzzle of why the United Kingdom’s union-inclusive multi-stakeholder initiative (MSI), the Ethical Trading Initiative, rose to national dominance, while two similar MSIs failed in Germany (the Roundtable Codes of Conduct) and Sweden (DressCode). They find that these differing outcomes can be explained by the approaches of Northern unions to address problems of representation in relation to Southern workers in governance struggles, and how effectively they used the power resources at their disposal. The authors develop an agentic theory of union resourcefulness based on these findings, which complements extant structural arguments. Drawing on theories of ideational power resources, they show how sensemaking processes are central to marshaling and (re)creating power resources.

By comparing five trade unions' social partnership responses in the US‐American and English healthcare systems, this article argues that trade unions' ideological position on partnerships and their level of ‘sectoral power’—which involves membership size and their recognized ability and willingness to pursue sector‐wide aims—influence social partnership choices in LMEs more so than national institutional factors. The article contributes to the study of social partnership by departing from the prevailing assumption that macro‐institutional supports are a necessary condition for unions’ strategic choice of social partnerships, instead, conceptualizing the organizational and sectoral conditions of a more agential pathway to social partnerships based partly on a novel type of union power (‘sectoral power’) where macro‐institutional supports are absent.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.12395,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

By analyzing multiple types of strikes, this study challenges more conventional understandings of work stoppages as predominantly indefinite conflicts to resolve bargaining impasses.

Drawing on an ethnographic case study in Barrio Chino (Ica) and surveys, we examine how mobilization emerged in such an adverse context for collective action.

Second, it adapts the concept of ‘community of struggle’ to explain how shared experiences of life and work can structure effective organizing practices without formal affiliation. The analysis reveals a key tension: The organizational fluidity that enabled rapid and effective mobilization also hindered the consolidation of permanent structures.

The analysis replicates the standard findings on wage and hiring elasticity, potentially revealing an additional layer‐abstention from collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) could lead to a double markdown on wage costs. Moreover, employer concentration reduces both employer association membership and union representation within small firms. In concentrated labour markets, there is a higher likelihood of forgoing both first‐tier and second‐tier collective agreements, resulting in adverse effects on workers' wages and non‐wage attributes. Additionally, even when firms use CBAs, strategies to optimise labour costs at the expense of workers emerge, prominently featuring the misalignment of CBAs. Local labour market concentration increases employment practices that optimise and reduce labour costs, such as a greater reliance on part‐time contracts and external consultants. The analysis shows that reduced competition in the labour market influences diverse facets of employment relationships, revealing patterns that extend beyond the conventional understanding of wage and hiring dynamics.",Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.70002,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z
