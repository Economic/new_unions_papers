https://openalex.org/W7128627302,Innovation Union: Costs and Benefits of Innovation Policy Coordination,Teodora Borota Milicevic; Fabrice Defever; Giammario Impullitti; Adam Spencer,2026-02-09,"Abstract What is the scope for international cooperation in innovation policy in economies closely integrated via trade? We address this question by building a two-region innovation-driven growth model with endogenous technology diffusion via FDI. We use the model to analyse R&amp;D subsidy cooperation in the EU, which has a common trade and monetary policy but where a coordinated innovation policy is still in its infancy. Stark differences in innovation capabilities between the West (old member states) and the East (new member states) shape optimal policies. Western countries have higher R&amp;D efficiency and serve as primary sources of knowledge spillovers, through FDI-driven technology transfer. Cooperation is driven by two factors: correcting distortions from subsidy competition, the strategic motive, and leveraging intertemporal knowledge spillovers that sustain growth. A coordinated policy involves substantial subsidies for the West and taxes for the East, reflecting the West’s superior R&amp;D efficiency and role as a key source of knowledge spillovers. Both regions experience welfare gains, primarily by internalising cross-border spillovers. We find strong complementarity between innovation and FDI subsidies, showing that jointly supporting knowledge creation and diffusion yields greater benefits than implementing each policy in isolation.",Journal of the European Economic Association,https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvag002,new,2026-02-13,2026-02-13T00:00:00Z

Park,2026-02-04,"ABSTRACT Decarbonization heightens risks for workers, but union strategies shape how these risks are managed and whether new jobs offer quality employment. This paper compares U.S. and Canadian auto unions during the 2023 Detroit Three bargaining, focusing on strategic capacities and internal politics to explain their divergent responses to the EV transition. Both unions emphasized a just transition and secured significant gains through the negotiations. However, the UAW's militancy emerged as a compensatory mechanism for weakened capacity, while Unifor's traditional approach stemmed from organizational resilience. We argue that understanding this counter‐intuitive relationship between capacity and militancy is critical to understanding cross‐national differences in labor's climate strategies.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70024,new,2026-02-08,2026-02-08T00:00:00Z
