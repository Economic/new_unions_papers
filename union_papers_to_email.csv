https://openalex.org/W4410897158,Leaders in Social Movements: Evidence from Unions in Myanmar,Laura Boudreau; Rocco Macchiavello; Virginia Minni; Mari Tanaka,2025-05-30,"Social movements are catalysts for crucial institutional changes. To succeed, they must coordinate members’ views (consensus building) and actions (mobilization). We study union leaders within Myanmar’s burgeoning labor movement. Union leaders are positively selected on both ability and personality traits that enable them to influence others, yet they earn lower wages. In group discussions about workers’ views on an upcoming national minimum wage negotiation, randomly embedded leaders build consensus around the union’s preferred policy. In an experiment that mimics individual decision-making in a collective action setup, leaders increase mobilization through coordination.

https://openalex.org/W2202392936,On the Optimal Design of a Financial Stability Fund,Árpád Ábrahám; Eva Cárceles‐Poveda; Yan Liu; Ramón Marimon,2025-09-19,"Abstract We develop a model of a Financial Stability Fund (the “Fund” henceforth) for a union of sovereign countries. By design, the contract prevents country defaults, as well as undesired expected losses, which in a union translate into excessive risk mutualizations. A participant country has greater ability to borrow and share risks than using sovereign debt financing. The Fund contract also provides better incentives for the country to reduce endogenous risks. These efficiency gains arise from the ability of the Fund to offer long-term contingent financial contracts, subject to limited enforcement and moral hazard constraints. We develop the theory and quantitatively compare the constrained-efficient Fund economy with an incomplete markets economy with default. We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis. The Fund is, in fact, a risk-sharing, crisis prevention and resolution mechanism, which transforms the participant countries’ defaultable sovereign debt into the union’s safe assets. In sum, our theory can help to improve current official lending practices and, for example, to eventually design a European Fiscal Fund.",The Review of Economic Studies,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf076,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W3125651330,A Network Formation Model Based on Subgraphs,Arun G. Chandrasekhar; Matthew O. Jackson,2025-02-28,"Abstract We develop a new class of random graph models for the statistical estimation of network formation—subgraph generated models (SUGMs). Various subgraphs—e.g. links, triangles, cliques, stars—are generated and their union results in a network. We show that SUGMs are identified and establish the consistency and asymptotic distribution of parameter estimators in empirically relevant cases. We show that a simple four-parameter SUGM matches basic patterns in empirical networks more closely than four standard models (with many more dimensions): (1) stochastic block models; (2) models with node-level unobserved heterogeneity; (3) latent space models; and (4) exponential random graphs. We illustrate the framework’s value via several applications using networks from rural India. We study whether network structure helps enforce risk-sharing and whether cross-caste interactions are more likely to be private. We also develop a new central limit theorem for correlated random variables, which is required to prove our results and is of independent interest.",The Review of Economic Studies,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf013,new,2025-11-10,2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

Leybourne; Robert Taylor,2024-11-10,"ABSTRACT The Bonferroni test is widely used in empirical studies investigating predictability in asset returns by strongly persistent and endogenous predictors. Its formulation, however, only allows for a constant mean in the predictor, seemingly at odds with many of the predictors used in practice. We establish the asymptotic size and local power properties of the test, and the corresponding Bonferroni ‐test, under a local‐to‐zero specification for a linear trend in the predictor, revealing that size and power depend on the magnitude of the trend for both. To rectify this, we develop with‐trend variants of the operational Bonferroni and tests. However, where a trend is not present in the predictor, we show that these tests lose (both finite sample and asymptotic local) power relative to the extant constant‐only versions of the tests. In practice, uncertainty will necessarily exist over whether a linear trend is genuinely present in the predictor or not. To deal with this, we also develop hybrid tests based on union‐of‐rejections and switching mechanisms to capitalise on the relative power advantages of the constant‐only tests when a trend is absent (or very weak) and the with‐trend tests otherwise. A further extension allows the use of a conventional ‐test where the predictor appears to be weakly persistent. We show that, overall, our recommended hybrid test can offer excellent size and power properties regardless of whether or not a linear trend is present in the predictor, or the predictor's degrees of persistence and endogeneity. An empirical application illustrates the practical relevance of our new approach.
