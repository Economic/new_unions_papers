De La Haye; Andrew Keyes; Pauline de Becdelièvre; Lorenzo Frangi; Jack Fiorito,2026-02-17,"ABSTRACT Satisfaction with union representation is often linked to a union's ability to improve compensation and working conditions (workplace instrumentality). Yet, union activities extend beyond the workplace, affecting social, political and economic outcomes. We explore workplace instrumentality and prosocial unionism as predictors of members’ ‘union experience’, a proxy for union satisfaction, in the United States, Canada and France. We propose that the workplace instrumentality effect on union satisfaction is strongest where union strategies are more market‐oriented (e.g., Canada and the United States), and that the prosocial unionism effect on union satisfaction is strongest where unions are more oriented to society and class (e.g., France). Results provide partial support but also demonstrate the importance of prosocial unionism as a key predictor in all three nations.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70043,new,2026-02-19,2026-02-19T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W7128996271,Strengthening the micro origins of macro multipliers via partial insurance and increasing returns,Gregory Givens; Tavoy Reid,2026-02-16,Abstract Macroeconomic models of government spending often depend on behavioral details with poor microeconomic validity. We propose a model that is more resistant to this critique in an effort to obtain credible estimates of key policy multipliers. Its success derives from the union of two separate but mutually reinforcing transmission mechanisms: unemployment with partial insurance and increasing returns from producer entry. Results show that our dual approach can generate positive consumption multipliers for a calibration choice that is in keeping with external data on the individual consumption cost of unemployment and on the average size of firm markups.,Economic Inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecin.70050,new,2026-02-19,2026-02-19T00:00:00Z
