https://openalex.org/W7118688911,The Union Wage Mark‐Up for Immigrants in the United States,Laszlo Goerke; Cinzia Rienzo,2026-01-07,"ABSTRACT Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1995–2023, we show that unionized immigrants earn 10.1 log points less than unionized natives, of which 4.8 log points are due to a lower union wage mark‐up. Therefore, unionization is beneficial for immigrants but to a lesser extent than for natives in the United States. The difference in the union wage mark‐up between natives and immigrants is most pronounced for males and low‐skilled blue‐collar workers.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70022,new,2026-01-10,2026-01-10T00:00:00Z
