https://openalex.org/W4417026273,The Dynamics of Legitimacy in Integrative Bargaining Over Restructuring,Christopher J. McLachlan; Mark Stuart,2025-12-04,"ABSTRACT This paper demonstrates the dynamics of legitimacy in integrative bargaining over restructuring. Through a case study of SteelCo, we show that cognitive legitimacy is essential to the identification of integrative potential, which interacts with pragmatic and moral legitimacy as bargaining evolves. Our findings also reveal the two‐way interrelationship between legitimacy and bargaining: just as legitimacy impacts the bargaining process, the conduct and outcomes of bargaining impact legitimacy. Our analysis highlights the risk integrative bargaining presents for unions, as it can involve not a single act of compromise but a gradual weakening of resources predicated on their moral legitimacy among workers.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70019,updated,2025-12-07,2025-12-09T05:39:59Z
https://openalex.org/W4416979482,The Role of Union Legitimacy and Identity in Shaping Strategic Choice,Geneviève Coderre‐LaPalme; Ruth Reaney,2025-12-03,"ABSTRACT This article explores how union legitimacy and identity shape union strategies. It highlights that while union identity is key to understanding strategic variation, legitimacy also plays a crucial role as unions must continuously earn and maintain it with various constituencies. Using cases from French automobile manufacturing and public healthcare, the article examines how local unions with distinct identities prioritize different forms and sources of legitimacy and, in turn, how this influences strategic choice. The findings show that unions formulate their strategies not only based on their identity, but also according to the need to uphold legitimacy with diverse constituencies.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70016,updated,2025-12-06,2025-12-07T05:39:25Z
