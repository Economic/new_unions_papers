https://openalex.org/W7105889681,Job Precarity and Attitudes Towards Labour Unions: The Mitigating Role of Immigrant Background,Anna-Lena Nadler; Elif Naz Kayran,2025-11-17,"ABSTRACT Despite their significant and growing role in the European workforce, to date, little research attention has been paid to immigrant workers’ attitudes towards trade unions and provided mixed results. On the one hand, immigrants are expected to be more positive towards unions due to their lower economic capital and greater need for job protection. On the other hand, immigrants may hold more pessimistic attitudes towards unions because of their reduced social network, lower perceived benefits of collective action and unions’ historical aversion to immigrant workers. Here, we contribute to this understudied field of research by concentrating on increasing job precarity in non‐standard employment forms which is highly concentrated among immigrant workers. More specifically, we ask to what extent does the internationalization of the workforce and the increasing presence of non‐standard employment relate to attitudes towards trade unions in advanced democracies? We argue that immigrants in precarious employment face a double vulnerability where the distinct importance of the workplace for the social and political integration of immigrants, the reinforcement of pre‐existing immigrant‐specific labour market discrimination, and the link between employment and residence status could explain why job precarity has particularly negative effects on immigrants´view of unions compared to natives. Using an original survey data from 13 Western European countries, we show that while immigrant status alone is not a predictor of attitudes towards unions, immigrants in temporary contracts have significantly more adverse attitudes towards unions than those immigrants in permanent contracts. Importantly, when compared with native workers, there is a wider cleavage in attitudes towards unions among immigrant workers based on the precarity of their employment status, highlighting this clear intersection of immigrant status and employment precarity in shaping attitudes towards unions. Our findings highlight a crucial issue that needs to be addressed for the future sustainability of social dialogue and industrial relations in Europe.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70024,new,2025-11-20,2025-11-20T00:00:00Z
iza18265,The Evolution of Hours Worked and the Gender Wage Gap: Theory and Evidence from Four Countries,Daniele Checchi; Daniel Kreisman; Cecilia García-Peñalosa,2025-11-01,"We consider the contribution of the intensive margin of labor supply (hours worked above zero) to the gender wage gap across four economies (Germany, France, US, UK) over a long time-horizon. We first build a model in which firms offer two wage contracts – one that pays a fixed wage but allows workers to choose their preferred number of hours up to “full time”, and a second in which wages are relative to imperfectly observable productivity but hours can be limitless. The former includes part- and full-time work, while the latter represents a class of workers who often must supply very long hours but who can then earn potentially unlimited remuneration. We then apply a Oaxaca decomposition for part-, full-, and over-time workers to observe the relative contribution of sorting and remuneration across these hours “regimes” over time and across countries. Through this, we show that while female employment in over-time work increased and the gender wage decreased, this was not driven by increasing selection but rather by a decrease in the unexplained portion of the wage gap over time. We conclude by considering the contribution of unions and labor market flexibility to these cross-country differences.",IZA Discussion Paper,https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/18265/the-evolution-of-hours-worked-and-the-gender-wage-gap-theory-and-evidence-from-four-countries,new,2025-11-20,2025-11-20T00:00:00Z

We conceptualize labour as a strategic agent that frames QWL challenges, mobilizes power resources and shapes bargaining outcomes. Distinct production regimes—flexibility‐driven in trucks and automation‐based in car components—generate specific discontents. Labour mobilizes associational and structural power by framing these discontents and leveraging institutional and coalition‐based resources to articulate them as actionable grievances. These processes vary by sub‐sector and country, shaping how integrative and distributive bargaining trade‐offs between QWL dimensions, including job insecurity, are negotiated in each case. By highlighting the dynamic, context‐dependent negotiations, we update labour process debates for the I4.0 context and advance power resource research by shifting focus from static capital–labour configurations of power to context‐dependent, labour‐led processes of change.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70022,updated,2025-11-16,2025-11-17T05:41:55Z

A theoretical model suggests that higher union density flattens the Phillips curve, amplifying output responses while dampening the inflation effects of monetary shocks. This is empirically confirmed using an interacted panel VAR. In contrast, benefit replacement rates and employment protection legislation have a limited impact. Our findings point to a structural, not cyclical, driver of monetary policy effectiveness, highlighting the importance of labour market features. In a monetary union, such heterogeneity can lead to inefficient inflation and output differentials across member states.",Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.70029,updated,2025-11-16,2025-11-17T05:41:55Z
