We conceptualize labour as a strategic agent that frames QWL challenges, mobilizes power resources and shapes bargaining outcomes. Distinct production regimes—flexibility‐driven in trucks and automation‐based in car components—generate specific discontents. Labour mobilizes associational and structural power by framing these discontents and leveraging institutional and coalition‐based resources to articulate them as actionable grievances. These processes vary by sub‐sector and country, shaping how integrative and distributive bargaining trade‐offs between QWL dimensions, including job insecurity, are negotiated in each case. By highlighting the dynamic, context‐dependent negotiations, we update labour process debates for the I4.0 context and advance power resource research by shifting focus from static capital–labour configurations of power to context‐dependent, labour‐led processes of change.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70022,updated,2025-11-16,2025-11-17T05:41:55Z
https://openalex.org/W7105644785,The Role of Labour Market Institutions in Shaping Euro Area Monetary Policy Transmission,Maximilian Boeck; Christian Glocker; Maximilian Boeck; Christian Glocker,2025-11-14,"ABSTRACT We examine how labour market institutions shape monetary policy transmission in euro area countries. A theoretical model suggests that higher union density flattens the Phillips curve, amplifying output responses while dampening the inflation effects of monetary shocks. This is empirically confirmed using an interacted panel VAR. In contrast, benefit replacement rates and employment protection legislation have a limited impact. Our findings point to a structural, not cyclical, driver of monetary policy effectiveness, highlighting the importance of labour market features. In a monetary union, such heterogeneity can lead to inefficient inflation and output differentials across member states.",Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.70029,updated,2025-11-16,2025-11-17T05:41:55Z
