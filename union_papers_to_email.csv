Carpenter; Erwan Dujeancourt; Samuel Mann; Lucia Naldi,2025-05-09,"We use Swedish administrative data from 2001-2021 to study sexual orientation and multiple job holding. We identify over 19,000 employed individuals who ever entered a legal same-sex union and compare their outcomes with all employed individuals who were only ever in different-sex unions. We find that sexual minority individuals are significantly more likely than otherwise similar heterosexual individuals to hold multiple jobs. We explore four mechanisms: financial constraints, self-insurance, career mobility, and job heterogeneity. We find evidence in line with self-insurance mechanisms for sexual minority men. For women, we find that career mobility is a likely explanation.",The Journal of Human Resources,https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.0324-13477r1,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W7128433132,Get on the Job and Organize: Standing Up for a Better Workplace and a Better World,Leonard Bierman; Rafael Gely,2026-02-09,"In Get on the Job and Organize, Jaz Brisack provides a well-written account of a trio of union organizing campaigns in the United States in the last decade. Brisack briefly describes unsuccessful campaigns involving Nissan and Tesla. She spends most of the book, however, describing the successful campaign involving Starbucks, which started in upstate New York and eventually expanded to over 600 stores across the United States. Brisack's account is personal, as she was involved in all three efforts, and provides insights which likely would have been missed by outside observers. For instance, Brisack describes Starbucks’ reaction to the organizing campaign of sending supervisors and high-level executives to the specific stores targeted by the union. She describes not only their actions but also their comments and even their outfits (pp. 104–105), presenting a vivid portrait of the company's strategy. Her account is not only personal, but also well-grounded in history, labour relations theory and legal context. For example, Brisack describes how Starbucks stretched the limits of the law to implement their campaign ‘playbook’ by ‘targeting individuals, targeting stores for closure, and targeting all workers in a sweeping form of collective punishment’ (p. 192), and later during collective negotiations by impeding bargaining. Brisack points out that US labour law, ‘orders companies to bargain in good faith, but lacks authority to punish those that don't’ (p. 204). Along the way, Brisack touches on various other important issues for those interested in labour relations, such as the tension that existed between the local organizers and the international union (pp. 214–219, 238–260), and her assessment of the most important benefits of unionization. She notes, ‘organizing allows workers the ability to take ownership and agency over the systems that try to strip people of their dignity, personhood, and self-determination’ (p. 267). The book provides a broad and helpful portrait of the organizing process in the United States and of the difficulties workers confront in that regard. At its core, however, this book is about something called ‘salting’, as evidenced by the book's dedication ‘[t]o the courageous, dedicated and caring salts …, who volunteered to get jobs at Starbucks and helped revitalize the labour movement’. Quoting a top union leader, Brisack defines salting as ‘the practice of getting a job at a nonunion workplace with the intention of organizing it’ (p. 39). Brisack describes her role as cofounder of the Inside Organizer School (IOS), a school founded with the goal of training people to become ‘salts’ by providing training programs on how to successfully ‘hire into’ an organization with the intent of union organizing. At the IOS, prospective salts practiced how to respond to job interview questions. For example, in response to a question like ‘[w]hat do you think of employees that gripe, gripe, gripe?’, a salt is advised to answer, ‘[I]f they don't like their jobs, they should leave rather than dragging everyone else down with them’ (p. 45). Brisack then describes in detail the Starbucks organizing campaign which involved her becoming a salt at Starbucks. Despite her constant fear that Starbucks would find out that she was a union organizer and not hire her, after 2 months of follow-up calls and visits she landed a salting job at the Elmwood Buffalo, New York Starbucks store (p. 63). Brisack set about consciously ‘befriending’ her coworkers, finding out relevant useful information about them and turning them into ‘peppers’ (extant workers who become part of the organizing process). Brisack's efforts ended in success when the majority of workers at Elmwood voted in favour of unionization and became the first unionized Starbucks coffee shop in the United States. Brisack's commitment and admiration for salting as an organizing strategy is clear. The practice is described as ‘heroic and righteous’ and ‘unparalleled in its effectiveness’ (pp. 39–40). As such, the book could be seen as something of a paean to salting and its use as a union organizing method from the unique perspective of a salt herself. Despite Brisack's enthusiasm for salting and its demonstrable effectiveness in the Starbucks campaign, Brisack's account reveals various issues that merit mentioning. First, salting involves a non-trivial amount of deception. Brisack notes that becoming a salt involves the ‘contortion’ of becoming a ‘commodity’ to your employer while also maintaining qualities that allow you to ‘build relationships of trust and camaraderie with coworkers’ of the kind that gets them to support labour unionization (p. 44). That is, obfuscating the truth is necessary and almost inevitable. Second, this deception is costly, taxing and has consequences. Brisack describes the tension she experienced in having to ‘ingratiate …. to management’, while not being seen as ‘too much of a goody-goody’ to her coworkers (p. 79). Brisack also describes the discomfort she felt when asked by coworkers at their first organizing meeting if she had come to Starbucks to organize them. ‘I wanted to tell them the whole truth’, writes Brisack, ‘but it was still risky’ (p. 101). Brisack also notes that while the organizing effort at Starbucks was successful, as of the book's mid-2025 publication the goal of reaching a labour contract with the company had not yet been achieved. If Brisack and her fellow union organizers at Starbucks are ultimately not able to reach labour contracts with the company, their organizational victories may in many respects end up being somewhat Pyrrhic in nature. Finally, Brisack laments how difficult the organizing process has become. The reason is rather complex and relates to the predominance the US Supreme Court gives employer's property interests. This policy choice has limited the ability of non-employee union organizers to communicate with employees at work, leaving unions few options but to engage in salting as the tactic of choice.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.70045,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z

https://openalex.org/W4408360634,Rigid yet resilient: Firms’ margins of adjustment to demand shocks in regulated labour markets,Claudio Lucifora; Federica Origo,2025-03-12,"• We study firm labour cost adjustment to changes in real sales • Adjustment works through employment and short-time work • Wages are less sensitive to declining sales • Unionized firms use more short-time work, reducing employment adjustment • Profits significantly react to declining sales in low unionized firms We investigate how firms adjust to demand shocks when wages and employment determination are regulated. Using firm-level data for the Italian metal engineering industry from 2009 to 2021, we estimate the elasticity of the wage bill to changes in firm's real sales. We disentangle the effect on wage components (base wage and wage cushion) and labour inputs (permanent or temporary employment and working hours). Results show that the elasticity of the wage bill to demand shocks mainly works through adjustment of working hours (especially via short-time work) and partly employment, while wages are less sensitive. Unions at the workplace reduce employment adjustment through a more intensive use of short-time work schemes. The lower employment adjustment to changes in sales in unionized firms does not depend on past investments or innovation, and it is associated to higher responsiveness of profits to declining sales only in weakly unionized firms.",Labour Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2025.102706,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
https://openalex.org/W4408382786,Changemakers. Radical Strategies for Social Movement Organiser,Martin Parker,2025-03-11,"When faced with the scale and complexity of the problems that face us, it is tempting to pull up the duvet and weep silently. The polycrisis reaches everywhere, and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Radical academics might like to think that the power of evidence and a reasoned argument might win the day, but their muttering is rarely heard outside the seminar room, or from behind the publishers paywall. So how to keep hope alive? In this book, such handwringing is put aside in favour of practical advice on how radicals might win. Jane Holgate and John Page have form in this area, having been long involved in many social protests, both workplace based and concerned with other social and environmental issues. They are serial dissenters, and in this intriguing and well-written book, they use their experience to put forward strategies that they think social movement organizers need to think about if they want to win. Some of these ideas come from trade unions and workplace struggles, but they range much more widely than that, referring to the civil rights movement in the United States, hunt saboteurs, gay rights, anti-fascist groups and so on. Holgate and Page are interested in what radicals can learn about ‘organizing for transformational social change’ (8) from successful and unsuccessful campaigns. This means being clear about strategy and theories of change because the point of the exercise is to gain power, not just smash windows and then go home. This means producing durable bottom up social movements. According to a pop management fable which they quote approvingly, if you chop a spider's head off, it will die, but a starfish can grow a new body from a severed limb (Brafman and Beckstrom 2008). The implication is that starfish organizations are more robust, and that organizers should be sceptical about charismatic leadership because it is vulnerable and myopic. It would be nice if someone had explained that to the US tech bros. For their illustrations, the authors turn to a more honourable tradition of organizing in the United States. Saul Alinsky was the founder of the Industrial Areas Foundation, a community organizing network established in 1940 in Chicago. Myles Horton established the Highlander Folk School (now the Highlander Research and Education Center) in Tennessee in 1932. Alinsky, in his 1971 Rules for Radicals, described a form of charismatic leadership which was always trying to stay ahead by setting the stage for any confrontation with the opposition. Horton, by contrast, was convinced that robust organization must be based on democratic community decision-making. The difference between their top down and bottom up approaches really structures this book, with the authors acknowledging the importance of Alinsky's inspiring ability to throw the opposition off balance, but continually preferring Horton's careful insistence that radicalism cannot be handed down from on high, but must be built by the people themselves. What Holgate and Page really want to encourage is not merely mobilizing, getting your supporters onto the streets for a demonstration, but long-term self-propelled organizing. Much of this work will not be heroic, not a ‘moment of the whirlwind’ (88) in which slogans are coined while speakers declaim, but a patient building of networks and resources which produce an inexorable movement towards change. Such organizing is also necessarily democratic and inclusive because it must connect to as many people as possible in order to be successful. Vanguardism will not work in the long term. Being ‘stuck in protest’ (240) will not help build robust and sticky alternatives. Another recent book from the same publisher comes to similar conclusions in terms of the long run prospects for enduring social change (Roth and Saunders 2024). It seems that change happens because of hard and hidden work in multiple sites, not dramatic confrontations. I really liked this book, but kept on hoping that it would not fall into the hands of the enemy. The strategies that Holgate and Page describe are, of course, reversible and could just as easily be applied by ‘take back control’ Brexiteers, MAGA populists, neoliberal managers and a host of pantomime villains. That is the problem with politics because there are always at least two sides, and they do not agree on who the white hats and the black hats are. It is also interesting that so many of the terms that the authors use are the staple of the business school too—leadership and management (and the difference between the two), as well as strategy, organization, empowerment, change, narrative and so on. It is sad, and I do not blame the authors for this, that there has been so little connection between industrial relations and critical management studies on these questions because many of these terms have been the objects of common critique and their reinvention is so important if we are to produce a low-carbon, high inclusion, high democracy economy (Parker 2018). This requires knowledge that goes beyond academic books, and Holgate and Page are also teaching these lessons through the Ella Baker School of Organizing, a training ground for activists of all kinds. Ella Baker played an important part in the civil rights struggles in the United States for most of the 20th century. In 1960, she helped to found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and throughout her life was a powerful advocate for grassroots organization, for the ability of oppressed peoples of whatever kind to express their own criticisms of the system that bears down on them, and to formulate strategies for change. This book is a powerful argument for the possibility that we all might learn from Ella Baker and connect the university to wider struggles for social justice.",British Journal of Industrial Relations,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjir.12878,new,2026-02-21,2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
