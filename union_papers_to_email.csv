Robots do not affect the total employment rate but significantly increase the involuntary atypical employment share, mainly through fixed‐term work. Software and databases increase total employment and are neutral for atypical employment. Higher trade union density mitigates the robots' impact on atypical employment, while employment protection legislation plays no role. Using historical decompositions, we attribute 1–2 percentage points of a 15% average atypical employment share in our sample to automation.",Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/irel.70017,new,2025-12-19,2025-12-19T00:00:00Z
